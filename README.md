# Mini-Watch-Cleaner
Meet the Mini Watch Cleaner, a compact, 3D-printed machine designed for cleaning mechanical watch parts. This device features a few crucial components - most notably a continuous servo (geared up for sufficient RPM), an Arduino Pro Mini controller (for reversing spin direction every 5 seconds), and a small 4-digit LED display that shows a countdown and offers simple user interaction through two buttons. Below is an overview of the design, assembly notes, and usage instructions.

The Arduino Pro Mini is housed in a small compartment next to the servo, wired up to:

The servo for directional control (reverses every 5 seconds).
- A 4-digit LED display for showing a countdown timer, cycle progress, and user modes.
- Two buttons provide simple menu navigation and mode selection:
  - Cleaning Mode
  - Rinse Mode
  - Slow Cleaning Mode
